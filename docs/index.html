							Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a special class of machine learning algorithms that were
							introduced to work with graph structured datasets. It facilitates the analysis of real world
							data that naturally occur as graphs in various disciplines, by exploiting the structural
							information contained in these data.

							Examples include prediction of protein interfaces for
							drug design, prediction of chemical properties, recommender systems, disease prediction and
							social network analysis.

							The input to the GNN is a graph of the form G=(V,E, A), where V are the nodes of the graph,
							E are the edges and A is the adjacency matrix. The nodes and edges can contain additional
							attributes or features. The node attributes usually describe the properties of the sample
							represented by the node, and the edge attributes describe the nature of the relationship
							between the nodes.

						<p>
							For example, if the nodes of a graph represent a plant, then the node
							attributes could describe the physical properties of the plant like the height of the plant,
							the number of leaves it contains and age of the plant. The edge attributes in this case
							might describe how two plants are related - flowering/non-flowering, annual/perennial and
							spore bearing/seed bearing.

							GNNs could be used either for node level, edge level or graph level tasks. The working
							mechanism of GNNs can be explained in terms of message passing framework.
						</p>

						<b>Input:</b>
						<ul>
							<li> Graph G with V_i vertices and E_i edges, i = 1 ….. N </li>
							<li> Each of the vertices has an M-dimensional feature vector X </li>
							<li> Adjacency matrix is Nx N matrix A </li>


						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="row step">
						<p>
							GNNs are built upon the message passing algorithm. The message passing algorithm has an
							aggregate step and an update step.
							For each layer of GNN, the aggregate step gathers information from the neighborhood of each
							of the vertices, and the update step updates the node features of the vertices with the
							aggregated information based on an aggregation rule. Different aggregation rules make up for
							different flavors of GNNs - Graph Convolutional Networks - mean aggregation rule, Graph
							Attention Networks - weighted mean aggregation rule.
